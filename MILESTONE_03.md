## Special Instructions for Using Form 1
When redirected to connect, you can create a wallet with the Sign Up or Coinbase Wallet option, then create an account and use a passkey called whatever you want. You should automatically be redirected to the dashboard, then you can press the black button to go to the form. There you can input a task + description. It will take a bit to generate, then redirect you to that task's page. You can go back to `/dashboard` to see the change reflected in the database.

## URL for form 2
[dashboard](https://verbose-giggle-v74v7jxx6453665-3000.app.github.dev/dashboard)

## Special Instructions for Using Form 2
After a task tree is generated, you will be redirected to that task's page (Also accesible by clicking one of the cards on `/dashboard`). On this page, you can unravel different subtasks within the tree page by clicking on the nodes, and you can select the checkboxes to mark certain tasks as complete. To submit the second form, press the **Save Changes and Exit** button, which will allow changes to the completion state of the task tree to be persistent.
