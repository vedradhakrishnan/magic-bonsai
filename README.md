 # Research Topics for MagicBonsai
 
 ## 1. Frontend Framework: React + ShadCN
 ### What is it?
 React is a popular library for UI, and ShadCN is a component library that accelerates UI development customizable components.
 
 ### Why use it?
 Using React allows for a dynamic and interactive frontend experience, while ShadCN provides a pre-styled component system that speeds up development. This combination ensures a visually appealing and intuitive UI.
 
 ### Possible Solutions:
 - **React.js** for core UI
 - **ShadCN UI** for UI components
 - **Next.js** for SSR.

 ## 3. Unit Testing with Jest
 ### What is it?
 Jest is a testing framework for JavaScript that allows devs to write unit tests.
 
 ### Why use it?
 By implementing unit tests, we ensure that core features work as expected. This increases the stability of the application and prevents bottlenecks during development.
 
 ### Possible Solutions:
 - **Jest** for unit testing

 ## 3. User Authentication with JWT & bcrypt
 ### What is it?
 JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a secure way to authenticate users, while **bcrypt** is used for securely hashing passwords before storing them in the database.
 
 ### Why use it?
 Authentication ensures that users can securely manage their info. JWT enables token-based authentication, which is scalable for web applications, and **bcrypt** enhances password security by hashing and salting credentials.
 
 ### Possible Solutions:
 - **jsonwebtoken (JWT)** for secure session management
 - **bcrypt.js** for password hashing

 ## 4. Interactive Tree Visualization with Three.js
 ### What is it?
 Three.js is a JavaScript library for 3D visualizations.
 
 ### Why use it?
 Since MagicBonsai is focused on gamified task management, the bonsai tree should visually change as users complete tasks. Three.js enables this for a more immersive experience.
 
 ### Possible Solutions:
 - **Three.js** for 3D tree rendering
