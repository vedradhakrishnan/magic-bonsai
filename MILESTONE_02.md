## Special Instructions for Using Form (or Login details if auth is part of your project)
When redirected to connect, you can create a wallet with the Sign Up or Coinbase Wallet option, then create an account and use a passkey called whatever you want. You should automatically be redirected to the dashboard, then you can press the black button to go to the form. There you can input a task + description. It will take a bit to generate, then redirect you to that task's page. You can go back to `/dashboard` to see the change reflected in the database.
